1. This is the part number for 300ft which is more than anyone would use in a
lifetime. Trust me I have 300Ft of it in my apartment and I still can't seem
to use it fast enough to make a dent.
2. This is one 60cm cable cut in half so the quantity you need to order per
unit is 1.
3. This part is designed by us and custom manufactured to our design. The
files for this are included in this project.

Suggested Tools

Temperature controlled soldering irong - Hakko 888, Pace ADS-200, or similar
Tweezers - SA-00 fine point
Crimp tool - Molex KK series (see warning)


Warning: The matching of the Molex connector housings to pins is
ultraspecific. You may notice a number of pairings that fit together and work
for short periods or even long ones in untouched enclosed use. However it has
been our bitter experiance that in the hands of investigators only the exact
match will last as long as we would like. We have also been having trouble
lately getting the hand crimp tools for this to work lately. It appears the
quality control of them has declined at Molex IMHO and we suggest that if you
have repeated trouble inserting the crimped pins you buy another tool and try
again. Sorry.
